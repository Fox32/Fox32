## Magnetohydrodynamics
[![Magnetohydrodynamics combines the intuitive nature of Maxwell's equations with the easy solvability of the Navier-Stokes equations. It's so straightforward physicists add "relativistic" or "quantum" just to keep it from getting boring.](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/magnetohydrodynamics.png)](https://xkcd.com/1851/ "Magnetohydrodynamics combines the intuitive nature of Maxwell's equations with the easy solvability of the Navier-Stokes equations.
